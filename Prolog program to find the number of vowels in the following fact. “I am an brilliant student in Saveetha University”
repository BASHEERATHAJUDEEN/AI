Write a Prolog program to find the number of vowels in the following fact.
“I am an brilliant student in Saveetha University”


% Fact: store the sentence as a string
sentence("I am an brilliant student in Saveetha University").

% Rule: define vowels
vowel(Char) :-
    member(Char, [a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U]).

% Rule to count vowels in a list of characters
count_vowels([], 0).
count_vowels([H|T], Count) :-
    vowel(H), !,
    count_vowels(T, Rest),
    Count is Rest + 1.
count_vowels([_|T], Count) :-
    count_vowels(T, Count).

% Main predicate to get the vowel count
vowel_count(Count) :-
    sentence(Sentence),
    string_chars(Sentence, CharList),
    count_vowels(CharList, Count).


?- vowel_count(Count).
Count = 18.
